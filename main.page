<p>This is my website where I will post my ideas and views. I operate under a nom de plume because of the contraversial nature of my opinions, and because I advocate the use of illegal psychoactive substances. I can even give advice on where to obtain these. I am an explorer of the Dark Web and even have a few connections there, in fact this website is code I purchased off my special lady Kaizu Shibata.
<p>Most of my discourse under this name is disseminated through <a href="https://hbletter.com">The HB Letter</a> but sometimes writing I write more than most would be interested in within that audience. Many anecdotes are to be shared here. I write out of love for all that is great in humanity. Want to find out who I am? Then free me, end the drug war, stop the infantilisation and institutional repression of sexuality in youth and I will be able to say loud and proud who I really am. Until that battle is won: I excercise my right not to incriminate myself.
<p>I am a student of Objectivism and wish to be a true Objectivist with a book and all that. I intend at some point to write a magnum opus on extending Ayn Rand's theory of sex as presented by the character Dangy Taggart in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. I have changed my own sexuality as a homosexual through the wisdom of Dagny
<p>I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and have two people to thank: Ayn Rand and Klaus Nordby. I do not agree with the contemporary approach to the treatment of sexual abuse victims. I despise it when a victim or survivor calls it a loss of innocence, or that the abuser caused permanent damage.
<p>Instead I wish to describe my own paradigm inspired by Ayn Rand's theory of sex that the premature sexualisation of youth by perverts is merely <i>confusing</i> and to recover one must question some difficult premises. With a theory of sex rooted in reason, this is a lot easier than it seems. Trauma can seem permenent but the thoughts behind emotions can be changed. Many blank-out and refuse to face they have inherited their abusers premises.
<p>My goal as Johannes Rogers is to help others sexually abused who share my struggle. To do this I advocate one establish their sexuality anew in a romantic and loving context. Many of us, even myself once, keep the perverse premises of our abusers. I know that better than most, I was once diagnosed with stockholm syndrome decades ago.
<p>I hope you consider my ideas with reason not emotion. Sexuality based on reason means sexuality rooted in objective reality: our heterosexual biological features. Indeed, men can enjoy being with men, and this is not a bad thing. Having once considered myself gay I have through reconsidering the whole subject of sexuality as more than just an isolated celebration of life but a cornerstone of happiness integrated with my biology: a sexual attraction to women appears logical.
<p>To extend Ayn Rand's theory I find she had a small error of the naturalistic fallacy in her views regarding homosexuality. I also think there is an illogical equivocation many of her generation make between homosexuality and the sloppy premises of the gay rights movement.
<p>A closeted homosexual is something I am quite familiar with, as once I was a prositute. These men typically are not shy of ridicule or judgement but the foggy slogans and virtue signaling that plague gay social interaction.
<p>My work on sexual ethics however is scarcely about what is wrong in sex or immoral but nicomachean and how to integrate your sexuality, fetishes, lusts, and fantasies with a balanced moral life. While I reject the subjective, sexuality is a complex part of life which can be very different between individuals, and most individuals have a rational sexuality... even homosexuals. Even sadomasochism has a rational cause in our biological makeup: we have to cause pain for a girl when taking her virginity, so many individuals enjoy domineering sex.
