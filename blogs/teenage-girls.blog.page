%%##title=Teenage Girls
<p>I am one who has decided to be open about something many consider dark and taboo. Yet I believe many of us feel it, especially men, that the teenage girl is of great value. There are those who attribute this to perversion and a tendency they claim men have that is exploitative. I however think the nature of a general desire among men for teenage girls is far more innocent.
<p>One might usually attribute the attraction to a lack of aging or physical appearence. Yet even a teenage girl who was obese that seemed to like me had the usual effect. The attention of a teenage girl when positive makes me feel valued by a natural sort of standard. A teenage girls attention fills me with joy and glee.
<p>I believe it is not the appearence that makes them attractive, but the nature of our minds plasticity. A teenage girl is one who can go anywhere and be anything. I don't believe they can be stupid or consider them to be failures. While they can be delinquent they also an always turn it around.
<p>It is that the teenage girl is capable of many futures that makes me find them exciting, and it makes me want to make my mark on them and be a guiding part of their lives. Yet there are those cynical about men like me, that this desire is exploitation or that I pray on those without knowledge.
<p>I call it sexual Marxism myself, this idea that if you are not on a similar level to someone to whom you make love, that one is exploiting them. I find it illustrates the issues of altruism and feminism in our time, that my desire to influence a young girl is a desire to control or enslave such a girl. I in fact just want to give young girls the benefit of my experience.
<p>When it comes to sex and a young girl the Sexual Marxists see nothing but the pleasure I gain and it goes back to the modern taboo surrounding an adult males lust for a young girl. To me sex is a way of sharing ones highest values with another.
<p>Certainly, it is possible for one to mislead a young girl with false appreciation and imitate her highest values, but one can also do this with any other person. Certainly, the teenager has less knowledge of possible subversions - but those who do this are not lovers of teenage girls but trickers and charlatans.
<p>When I get to make love to a teenager it is a sacred thing to me. I do not use tricks or lies, and I do not break their hearts. A trickster who breaks a teenage girls heart is a monster, and should not be the standard for all men. Most of us don't exploit but simply value and reward.
<p>I find that when it comes to the issue of the age of consent that the standard should not be the mistakes a young person can make, but what they can understand. As such I think the age of consent should be 14, where one is going to be developed. Also at this age they are not merely impressionable, but ready to start the quest toward being a mature woman.
<p>A mature woman who has lived properly will have loved as a teenage girl. By lived properly I mean such a woman has a purpose in life that is productive. Certainly, those who have sex and things pushed on them far too young at say 10 or 12 can have issues with purpose.
<p>Yet a teenage girl who has a man at about 14 or 15 can choose what influence he has, and for most of human history it is at this beginning of pubescence where a young girl finds her true loves. For most of our history a young girl would have had a child.
<p>I love and adore teenage girls because they are naturally focused on life and moral values. I consider myself to be englightened compared to most men. Yet even most men can be a great influence for a young girl.
<p>As such the teenage girl and her unique nature is always going to be a value to most men out there, at least ones that are heterosexual. As some readers know I once considered myself gay, and I believe this was a confusion caused by not having had the right connections with teenage girls.
<p>As a part of changing my values and premises behind my sexuality, I went to nature and to the young teenage girls to initiate the basis of heterosexuality in myself. No teenage girls were harmed, and I have made some life long friends and lovers in the process.
<p>If you like young girls that is nothing to be ashamed of. I suggest you don't over analyize your attractions or push a feminist stereotype on yourself. Some who do this mistreat these little women, and miss the enlightening part of such relations. Some even cause harm, when initally they just wanted to be a part of a young ladies future.
<p>A teenage girl is always a virtue and is always capable of a great future.
