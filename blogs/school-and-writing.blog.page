<p><em>I explain some things already explained, and introduce my kind of relationship.</em>
<p>If I tell the average sort of person, even a friend, of my success at gaining the affections of young girls many think I am merely telling false stories. Many who get a young girl do it for a night and use much manipulation, mistruths, and appeal to their animal sexuality. Yet I am a soft man, and I never lie unless it is for self-preservation.
<p>As such many find me unbelivable, I do not know how you picture me your psuedononymous author but I am not physically remarkable. I have an isolated sort of existence and the resulting demeanor of one who stays at home. I am not the most fun, and have a strict sense of order and honour. So I am not the sterotypical sleezebag one expects to win vibrant teen girls.
<p>As you an tell writing is a part of my life, and this is actually the secret I possess. As the years have went on, I have a seasonal oppertunity open up for my life. I live in Australia but have immigrated here, and since my ventures to this great land there is soemthing the same in its summers which happen at the end and beginning of years.
<p>It is at times and in fact now, the time of writing, that I meet many gifted young girls who did well at school. At first I found networking with them interesting because I was from a land where girls did not get to go to school. Yet one thing became obvious and opened up dreams and my wildest sexual fantasies.
<p>I would meet this young girls with great minds who remind me of a boy first seperated by education from their mothers. These girls are living through a sort of opposite, where they are out of school and no longer hav teachers to impress. The ones I form a relationship with articulate and looking to be a part of the world.
<p>People find me through other writings in my real life, which on this blog I keep a secret. I am also known and many refer people to me who wish to master English and Arabic. On top of that I have a position in society and my local community in Australia for leadership and integrity.
<p>The Australian Seasons are a wonderful driver of this flourishment and life themselves. As such when the year ends, and the next year must be planned the Sun of our Sol burns with life. So I found many young girls who want me to read their writing and ideas. Not just grammer and technique but things schools lack like logic and rhetoric.
<p>I have lost many friends who picture me as liking young girls for their animal sexuality or exploitability. These people I see as trapped in a concept of sexuality that is disconnected from thought itself. That thought is stolen, for it uses thought for one to consider sexuality as thoughtless.
<p>It is in fact just that many young girls seek to be heard by someone such as myself. These girls have the innocence of any youth. Yet they are also at an age in their late teens of being able to handle judgement and harsh criticism. It is an age, and these girls I meet are usualy 17 or 18, that they start developing a moral compass.
<p>As many have always known 25 is usually a golden age for any person, and neuroscience confirms it well. At that age one has, in the right circumstances, wired a philosophy of some kind into their mind. For those without morals, and without critics and intellectual stimulation it can instead be a terrible age.
<p>I believe that is is my affections and interests that accord these girls with a healthy start. The girls that I get romantic with are not usually off to college. Most would find them gifted but many would not find them as having a great concept of purpose and where they belong.
<p>There are many who might now see how I work, but apply a standard of sexual marxism. They will say I should leave these girls for boys their age. For me to be a part of their lives as an inspiration is considered by most to be corrupt as soon as sex gets involved. Yet relationships are based on values not sacrifices, and the young ladies enjoy me as much as I enjoy them.
<p>As such one should be forthright about having such relations, one should defend their love of the young forever. In my real life a few have issue with what one could effectively label as inequality. I argue that the little girls benefit from me, and make clear my influence is not bought with sex.
<p>I get girls because we gain something from one another. I get to influence the culture and the young. I also gain being able to make this a better world. The girls gain standards to live by that are their own, and find influence toward making themselves adults. We both have sex.
<p>
