%%##title=It is okay to like young girls
<p>I talk to people about sexuality a lot and openly confess that I myself am a fan of the nymphets out there. Those being girls in early pubesence that are sexualised and seem ready, and they can be as young as 14. I know many of us find young girls attractive. Yet were seen as predators under todays sexual marxism, and there actually are predators out there. Yet I find its a package deal that I am classified with these people, whom target those who lack sexuality, whereas in my case I find attractive a young girl with a sexual gift of sorts and a guiltless sense of comfort in sex.
<p>The fact is that for most of human history of the human race we have been sexually active at the start of puberty. In these modern times it is quite taboo and pedophilia isn't tolerated. Yet these modern times are an anomoly in the historical sense. In fact, kids today who don't get to know sexuality until they are almost adults even have structural differences to the brain. It is said sexually abused kids are brain damaged, but really all they have as proof is differences in the wiring of the brain, and any deviation from the sexually represed kids is seen as damage.
<p>For most of human history we have been confusing ourselves over sexual nuances. A young boys inability to ejaculate and repsonse of pain instead of an orgasm happens for most of us men. A young girls sexual desires require the penetration and destruction of the hymen to be fulfilled and is very painful, and also the stretching of vagial tissues for a girl or even woman inexperienced with sex involves pain.
<p>It is a simple fact that as a man I have a biological imperative to break hymens as a requirement of reproduction. The hymen and a girls menstruation are seen in Christian cultures that I'm familiar with to be a punishment from God, which is a good example of the sexually primative.
<p>The hymen in fact is there to prevent the infection of young girls through the vagina. As humans unlike other animals we have to learn lots of things as knowledge and this includes using a toilet. Little humans especially little girls make a mess. In this age of science we now understand the hymen to a protective barrier until we learn to keep our genitals clean.
<p>Studies I've seen claim that of modern pregnanies the best age in terms of the health of of the mother and baby is fourteen. Yet someone that age in our modern world isn't equipped to be a mother. Unlike we were as cave men, providing for a family in the modern world requries skills and a role in a market economy.
<p>As such people find those who like young girls to be expoiters, and they're only half wrong. There are many men who abuse young girls and manipulate them, and they target the young girls who are sexually unaware as it associates with lower self-esteem to not know what their own genitals are for. Yet there are many young girls who are sexually aware, and as such one can ratonally find these young girls attractive.
<p>It is quite natural for a man to like younger girls, and I recommend that one explore this interest a little when one has the chance. Yet it disgusts me that every man who involves themselves with a pubescent but young girl is seen an exploitative monster. Some are, but sexuality is put in a sort of package deal of sexual pleasure and corruption. Innocence of a child is put in a package deal with sexual purity, as if the only reason a little girl ever has sex is through the interferences of men be in in childhood or much later as an adult.
<p>These package deals in sexuality are the result of sexual confusion in adolesence. The so-called sexual revolution of the sixties put sexaulity in a subjective context, and isn't the step-forward many claim. It merely gives up on sexual clairty, and with sexuality as being okay because reason isn't very important.
<p>Yet for many of us we integrate our sexuality with our reason, especially once we find our true love. Yet that all still depends if even love is associated with reason by an individual. When it comes to children and teenagers most claim they lack the capacity for using reason with their sexuality.
<p>The same people claiming to protect kids are sexualising them anyway, in an inverse sense. A child actually has a sexual capacity, and the fact is many punish kids for exploring it. As such purity and innocence are pushed onto children, to the opposite of the intended effect. A kid is made to feel guilty and corrupt when they don't meet these irrational expectations of purity in their desires and thoughts.
<p>I know a lot of men like young girls just as I do, and are mistakenly ashamed of themselves. It is actually something that is quite natural to us, and we required the trait to continue the human race through reproduction. We have a biological imperative to break hymens, and before medicine the best trait for a potential mother was youth in terms of survivability.
<p>Some feminist movements view this trait in males as corrupt. Yet this is just more inverse sexualisation and repression, where one completely evades their own sexual nature. It is a blank-out and is against reality as the standard of knowledge. So I have come to say that it is okay to be a man, and also that it is also okay to have liked men as a little girl and such. These aspects of our sexuality are harmless and natural.
<p>It is quite fine ethically to find young girls attractive and even to act on these desires. Yet this does not mean you a free to manipulate and defraud a young girl with lies and false love. If you really value a young girl you should understand. There are predators, and those are all we usually hear about.
