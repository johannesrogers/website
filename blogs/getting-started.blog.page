%%##title=Getting started
<p>So I have worked out the basics of using <em>picosite</em> which is a content management system by Kaizushi (kloshost.online). It works with the editor built in a shell account based web hosting account. It uses less than 500 lines of code and is apprently highly secure and uses NoSQL.
<p>I am building a website which is a blog and also will have essays by myself. I will write about taboo subjects and promote the use of DMT.
