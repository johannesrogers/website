%%##title=Private & Anonymous Streams
<p>Privacy is really about putting your data behind cryptography. Anonimity is about putting your data behind networks that distribute it. One needs both, and they are quite seperate.
<p>This is about concepts involved and not doing it with easy copy & paste commands for Linux. Related <a href="/page.php?q=linux">guides for Linux</a> may come into existence regarding this article.
<p>A private connection needs to be secured meaning you are in control, and that it is using security mitigations and such. It needs to be free of hackers and eavesdropping. VPNs come to mind and you should operate your own for it to be in your control. One should probably have for their private network their own certificate authority.
<p>Many connections considered private such as HTTPS connections using TLS can actually be manipulated. There are many possible certificate authorities. One may be compromised and sign your connection to a server. This could be done on a connection that isn't fully in your control. CA certs with ordinary webservers basically rest on civilisation and order. 
<p>Anonimity depends on networks like Tor and I2P and there are weaknesses because many control the stream you use to connect. When it comes to getting a circuit to an ordinary webserver the issues of CA abuse can arise. As such anonimity itself to be private requires special consideration.
<p>Cryptographic schemes can make things much better, and one can reach a Tor hidden service anonymously and privately. So one can have some communication with both, and avoid Tor exits. Yet now you are barred off from the world and only face the deep web. Yet the is also a cryptographic economy.
<p>You could buy with some Monero behind your Tor browser with some security, though you would be making the first step behind fallible HTTPS using TLS. Yet you could get a VPS server one way or another which is not traced back to you. On this you could simply point a hidden service to its SSH daemon.
<p>At that point you would have for yourself your own secret centre of communications with the rest of the internet. You could take further steps to check for the sanity and correctnesss of Internet CAs. Call it your private Tor exit, and connect with SOCKS using SSH dynamic port forwarding.
<p>We are at a point where one can be anonymous and in control of their systems with also the benefit of privacy. There are still some risks jumping it into action such as getting the VPS but you can get a pretty high level of security if done right.
<p>I suggest you do it while law and order and civilisation still stand. In these times one can with decent security set themselves up for anonimity and privacy combined.
<p>Keep in mind the CIA and many other spooky agencies around the world have a CA that can sign a connection. As such totalitarian governments could hijack the Internet. Thankfully things like property rights and trademark laws stand in the way.
<p>As far as VPNs go I find them pointless for anything but networking infrastructure secured by ones own CA, the only one it can use. You are much better off with things like SSH dynmic port forwarding with SOCKS.
<p>One could even utilise netfilter on the VPS server anonymously purchased I mention. This could forward things like emails to a Torified server.
